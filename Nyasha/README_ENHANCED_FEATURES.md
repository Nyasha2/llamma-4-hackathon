## 🚀 How It Works Now

### 1. **Book Processing** 📖
When you upload a book, the system:
- Scans the entire text for character names using advanced pattern matching
- Extracts dialogue patterns ("Alex said", "Mary asked")
- Finds possessive forms ("John's sword", "Sarah's house")  
- Identifies titles ("Mr. Smith", "Professor Jones")
- Filters out false positives and ranks by importance

### 2. **Character Profiling** 👤
For each character found:
- **Role Analysis**: Determines protagonist/antagonist/supporting based on context keywords
- **Trait Extraction**: Identifies personality traits from surrounding text
- **Backstory Creation**: Generates character background from their appearances
- **Relationship Mapping**: Finds connections to other characters

### 3. **Story Event Extraction** 📚
- **Chapter Analysis**: Splits the book into manageable sections
- **Event Classification**: Categorizes each paragraph by event type
- **Character Involvement**: Tracks which characters appear in each event
- **Location Tracking**: Identifies where events take place
- **Interactive Potential**: Determines what choices make sense for each event

### 4. **Dynamic Gameplay** 🎮
- **Contextual Choices**: Different choice types for dialogue vs. conflict vs. journey events
- **Consequence Generation**: Each choice affects the story world and character relationships
- **Story Continuation**: Generates new narrative content based on your decisions
- **Progressive Storytelling**: Story evolves beyond the original book based on your choices

## 🎯 Example Workflow

1. **Upload "The Adventure of Alex the Explorer"**
   - System finds: Alex (protagonist), Merlin (supporting), Guardian (antagonist)
   - Extracts 7 story events from chapters
   - Maps relationships: Alex knows Merlin, Alex faces Guardian

2. **Select "Alex" as your character**
   - Shows: "Alex (protagonist) - intelligent"
   - Displays Alex's backstory and importance score
   - Sets up starting point with Alex's perspective

3. **Start the Adventure**
   - **Backstory**: "Here's what Alex has experienced so far..."
   - **Current Situation**: Actual text from the book about Alex's current state
   - **Choices**: Context-appropriate options based on the current event type

4. **Make Choices**
   - **Custom Action**: "Alex investigates the mysterious letter carefully"
   - **Consequence**: System generates how this choice affects the story
   - **Next Choices**: New options based on your previous decision
