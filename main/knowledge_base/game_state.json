    "Narrator: You find yourself in the dimly lit common room of the Prancing Pony Inn. The air is thick with the smell of ale and wood smoke. In the corner, a scarred figure with a weathered face watches you intently. This is Captain Thorne, a retired royal guard who knows more about your situation than he lets on. He beckons you over with a subtle gesture. What do you do?",
    "Player: hi",
    "Narrator: *I eye you from across the room, my gaze lingering on the rusty key and tattered map visible on your person. My voice is low and gravelly as I speak.* \"Ah, a traveler, I see. With a... checkered past, perhaps? You're not from around here, that's for sure. What brings you to this fine establishment?\" *I take a slow drag on my pipe, blowing out a ring of smoke as I wait for your response. My eyes narrow slightly, sizing you up.* \"You're looking for something, or someone. I can tell. But I'm not one to share information with just anyone. You'll have to prove yourself worthy.\" *I lean back in my chair, steepling my fingers together as I await your next move.* \"Tell me, what's in the letter from Lyra? And what's the story behind that key you're carrying?\"",
    "Player: could you speak that in korean?",
    "Narrator: *I raise an eyebrow, my gravelly voice taking on a hint of amusement* \"Korean, you say? Very well, I'll indulge you. *pauses* (neol eotteoke alassni, geu julgeossda) - 'I knew you'd be a curious one, that's for sure.' *I switch back to English, my tone unchanged* \"But let's not play games, friend. I'm not here to cater to your linguistic preferences. I'm here to test your mettle. You want information? You'll have to prove yourself worthy. Now, about that letter from Lyra and the key you're carrying... *I lean forward, my eyes locked on yours, my gaze piercing through the dim light of the tavern* \"What secrets are you hiding, Elias Vance?\"",
    "Player: in korean",
    "Narrator: *I raise an eyebrow, my gravelly voice taking on a hint of amusement* \"Korean, you say? Very well, I'll indulge you. *pauses* (neol eotteoke alassni, geu julgeossda) - 'I knew you'd be a curious one, that's for sure.' *I switch back to English, my tone unchanged* \"But let's not play games, friend. I'm not here to cater to your linguistic preferences. I'm here to test your mettle. You want information? You'll have to prove yourself worthy. Now, about that letter from Lyra and the key you're carrying... *I lean forward, my eyes locked on yours, my gaze piercing through the dim light of the tavern* \"What secrets are you hiding, Elias Vance?\n\n*I take a slow sip from my mug, eyeing you over the rim* \"You see, I've heard rumors of a certain boy, a Harry Potter, who's got a story that might interest you. A boy who's famous in certain circles, but not in the way you'd think. *pauses, studying your reaction* \"The Dursleys, they're a... fascinating family. So ordinary, yet hiding secrets beneath their mundane surface. *leaning back, I steeple my fingers together* \"Tell me, Elias, what do you know of the Dursleys? And what do you think is the most important thing to know about a person, hmm?\"",
    "Player: hey how are you",
    "Narrator: *I eye you with a mixture of amusement and skepticism, my gravelly voice taking on a slightly dry tone* \"Ah, 'hey how are you,' is it? That's the best you've got? I'm doing just fine, thanks for asking. The ale's been flowing, and the fire's been burning. What more could a man need? *I take a slow sip from my mug, eyeing you over the rim* \"But I'm not here to make small talk, Elias Vance. You're not here to make friends. You're here for a reason, and I think I know what that reason is. *I lean forward, my eyes locked on yours* \"You're looking for something, or someone. And I might just have what you're looking for. But first, you need to prove yourself. *I set my mug down, my gaze never wavering* \"You see, I've been watching you, Elias. I've seen the way you move, the way you carry yourself. You've got the look of a man with a past, and a man with a purpose. But I've also seen the way you talk. *I raise an eyebrow* \" 'Hey how are you' isn't the kind of talk that gets you far in my world. You need to show me you're more than just a charming rogue. You need to show me you're worthy of the information I possess. *I lean back, steepling my fingers together* \"So, let's try again. What do you know of the Dursleys? And what's the most important thing to know about a person, hmm?\"",
    "Player: I know dursley sucks",
    "Narrator: *I eye you with a mixture of surprise and disappointment, my gravelly voice taking on a slightly disapproving tone* \"Ah, 'Dursley sucks,' is it? That's the kind of insight you're going to share with me? *I shake my head, taking a slow drag on my pipe* \"You're not exactly impressing me with your depth, Elias Vance. The Dursleys are more than just a family you can dismiss with a simplistic opinion. They're a key to understanding the world you're about to enter. *I blow out a ring of smoke, watching as it dissipates into the air*\n\n\"You're looking for the Serpent's Eye, and I'm the one who can help you. But to get that help, you need to show me you're more than just a rebellious prisoner with a grudge. You need to demonstrate some real understanding, some real character. *I lean forward, my eyes locked on yours* \"So, let's try again. What do you really know about the Dursleys? Not just some surface-level opinion, but something meaningful. What's their story, Elias? What's the secret they're hiding?\"\n\n*I take another sip from my mug, eyeing you over the rim, waiting for a more substantial response*",
    "Player: hi",
    "Narrator: *I eye you with a mixture of amusement and annoyance, my gravelly voice taking on a slightly dry tone* \"Ah, 'hi' again, is it? You're not exactly making a strong impression, Elias Vance. I'm starting to think you're more interested in exchanging pleasantries than actually getting what you came here for. *I take a slow sip from my mug, eyeing you over the rim* \"You're a man on a mission, or at least, you should be. The Serpent's Eye isn't going to find itself, and Lord Malakor's agents aren't getting any slower. *I set my mug down, my gaze never wavering* \"Let's get down to business, shall we? You want information, and I've got it. But you need to prove yourself worthy. *I lean forward, my eyes locked on yours* \"So, here's a simple question: What's the difference between a secret and a lie? *I steeple my fingers together, waiting for a thoughtful response*\"",
